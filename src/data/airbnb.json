An induction stove, kettle, toaste, pots and pans are available for use. Max and Billie are quick to respond to any queries which was helpful during the stay. The space was properly clean and there’s a table which served as a useful desk to work on during my stay. The only downsides I’ve found was that the water on the kitchen tap wasn’t available due to low pressure I believe, this was not much of an issue since the water of tap in the toilet sink is also drinkable and was always working. Self-checking was useful since I arrived quite late but it makes use of a digital key service called Klevio. This removes the need to make use of a lockbox but I found it can be cumbersome to navigate the app to open doors whilst carrying things or it can cause issues for your data ends and you’re not connected to the Wifi on the lower ground floor. Details are provided and I recommend connecting as soon as you check in. Additionally, make sure you always have your phone fully charged, running out of battery could mean you can get locked out. Otherwise it was a good stay, other guests were very respectful too. Thanks Max and Billie!",

The location is also convenient should you wish to tour the city. Billie is very prompt and attentive to guest requests which was a nice thing to see. Unfortunately, when booking I had not seen there is no lift in the property which made it harder for me to get to the top floor studio. But this was my error in not reading the advert correctly. A few things to remember - the shower has reduced pressure which can be a problem when you have long hair to wash! The corridor spaces are a little poorly lit and not finished to the same spec as the studio. Also, can be a problem if you are light sleeper as the sound travels easily through the thin party walls. However, when mentioned about this Billie did request the neighbouring occupier to keep the noise levels low. Overall, the stay was pleasant and would definitely recommend for short or long stays!",

Public transportation was very good (metro, tram and bus stations all less than 5 minutes walk from the apartment) which allowed us to get from the apartment to pretty much all the historic attractions in approx half an hour. Around the apartment are many restaurants, cafes and bars which all close late (not before midnight). All thing was that when we arrived we asked Roberto about the hot tub and he told us it was broken but did not tell us before booking or arriving. All in all the apartment was great and Roberto was a very helpful host (was flexible with check out time).",

I even walked one day to Harajuku and it maybe took 20 minutes. There's a row of restaurants and several convenience stores nearby. The apartment is located on the second floor, so prepare to haul heavy suitcases up a flight of stairs. The place is the perfect size for a solo traveler or couple- I would not recommend more than 2 people. The apartment was also very clean other than the table, which looked like it may have not been wiped from the previous guest.

If you are a single traveler or a couple, this is an ideal space and unlike anything else in the neighborhood. Moran was also very attentive and helpful to any question I had. One note: there is construction in the back (during the morning through afternoon) and as the apartment is ground level, there are often people walking by the front door etc. So it may be something to consider if you’re not used to “city noise”. Didn’t bother me at all, but I know others might not be used to noise as much. But highly recommend this beautiful and cozy special find in Florentine!",

We are currently drafting a letter to the Airbnb system to request a full refund of the trip. Because we didn't stay in the apartment for over an hour. The reactions of the guests before us were misleading. Luckily we continued on a trip we did in Tel Aviv. But with a bad feeling. Feeling distrustful.",
