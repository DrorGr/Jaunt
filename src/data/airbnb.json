I even walked one day to Harajuku and it maybe took 20 minutes. There's a row of restaurants and several convenience stores nearby. The apartment is located on the second floor, so prepare to haul heavy suitcases up a flight of stairs. The place is the perfect size for a solo traveler or couple- I would not recommend more than 2 people.
