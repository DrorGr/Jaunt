It's about a 5 minute walk to Yoyogi station which is conveniently located on the Yamanote Line that can directly get you to Shibuya, Shinjuku, Tokyo station and many more tourist spots. I even walked one day to Harajuku and it maybe took 20 minutes. There's a row of restaurants and several convenience stores nearby. The apartment is located on the second floor, so prepare to haul heavy suitcases up a flight of stairs. The place is the perfect size for a solo traveler or couple- I would not recommend more than 2 people. The apartment was also very clean other than the table, which looked like it may have not been wiped from the previous guest. That being said, I'm a clean freak and would still stay at and recommend this place.",
